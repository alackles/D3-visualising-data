The goal of these lessons is to visualize data. 
So far we haven't really dealt with any specific data, let alone 
relatively big data files.
In this lesson, we will learn about the basic data types used 
by JavaScript and also talk about ways to conveniently convert 
variables into a text file so we can store it.
